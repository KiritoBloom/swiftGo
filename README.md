# Swift Go E-commerce Project

Swift Go is a dynamic e-commerce project designed to enhance the shopping experience through the seamless integration of RESTful APIs. The project incorporates Clerk authentication to ensure secure and efficient user-based authentication. MongoDB serves as a robust database, efficiently managing the creation and storage of user information, including names and email addresses.

## Features

- **RESTful API Integration:** Swift Go leverages RESTful APIs to efficiently retrieve product information, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

- **Clerk Authentication:** To guarantee secure user authentication, Swift Go employs Clerk authentication, a reliable solution for managing user identities and permissions.

- **MongoDB Database:** The project utilizes MongoDB, a powerful NoSQL database, to create and store user information. This includes essential details such as names and email addresses, contributing to a robust and scalable data management system.
